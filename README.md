# simrest_validation
Simulation of resting state activity in macaque cortex and its validation with respect to experimental data


Simulation of resting state activity in macaque cortex
A workspace for validation of models of resting state activity in cortex by comparison of simulation results to experimental recordings

 

This project is also intended as a proof of concept implementation of a general workflow, using HBP tools, for comparison of electrophysiolocial and simulated data.
